## TL;DR üèÉ

This is a fully documented working configuration for Home Assistant, with screenshots, hints and comments. [Browse the code](https://github.com/albinmedoc/homeassistant-config/tree/master) to have a look! üëÄ

## Overview üåÖ

### Goals ‚öΩ

- **Inconspicuous**: I love tech alright, but like any good butlers it should stay out of sight yet stay summonable. Think Fiji villa, not server room.
- **Modular**: Both code and devices should be easily replaceable.
- **Internet independent**: As much local processing as possible for the essential features.
- **Accessible through multiple ways:** Computers, tablet (kiosk), voice, smart phones, wireless buttons, remotes.
- **Intuitive user interfaces:** One look at a group of sensors/switches should be sufficient for anyone to understand the current states and how to operate an interface. üí°
- **Redundant controls:** Multiple interfaces should be able to control devices without interference. State changes from manual interventions or dedicated manufacturer apps should be tracked whenever possible.
- **No information overload:** Provide just enough insights to get an idea of what's going on. And no need for data that's best consumed on more interactive devices (like stock prices, Steam community status‚Ä¶)

### Agile development üññ

This configuration is built with an [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/)-like methodology, lead by following main user stories:

- **As a resident** I want a reliable home automation platform to handle lights and climate that can easily be controlled and overridden in many intuitive ways.
- **As a developer** I want to use an open-source platform that is feature-rich, accessible, flexible and actively maintained.
- **As a consumer** I want to pick and choose which devices I wish to acquire without necessarily being locked into a closed ecosystem.
- **As a couple** we want to be able to operate lights and climate-control appliances as well as get quick overview of weather forecasts and public transit schedules through simple to use interfaces.

Tasks are hopefully defined in the [issue queue][link-issues] and their development progress is managed using a [lightweight Kanban board][link-board].
